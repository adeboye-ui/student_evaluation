# Student Evaluation System

A Python-based desktop application that uses an intelligent system to evaluate students based on multiple variables such as **attendance frequency, classwork performance, socialization, and neatness**. It employs **Tkinter** for the user interface and **scikit-learn's Decision Tree Classifier** to provide smart predictions on students' performance.

---

## Features
- **Add student evaluations** with performance metrics.
- **Predict student performance** using a machine learning model.
- **Data visualization** of evaluation results using matplotlib.
- **Edit and delete** student records from the local database.
- **Neat blue-themed GUI** with touches of yellow and white for an elegant look.
- Uses **SQLite** for local data storage.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Tkinter, SQLite, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree Classifier for student performance predictions
- **GUI**: Tkinter-based for cross-platform compatibility
